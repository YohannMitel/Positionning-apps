# Lab 4

## Objective  
Conceive a 5G NR setting application that, based on the average/max speed over an area (given by the coordinates of the square center), determines the optimal sub-carrier width, frequency band, and cyclic mode for that area.

## Requirements  
The application needs to extract information about:  
- Carsâ€™ speed over the road networks  
- Population density  
- Buildings  

## Data Sources  
Students can use any available API or data source. Some useful sources include:  

- **Export map data:** [OpenStreetMap Export](https://www.openstreetmap.org/export)  
- **Extract road network:** [Extracting Road Networks from OpenStreetMap](https://w3shaman.com/article/extracting-road-networks-openstreetmap)  
- **Extract buildings:** [Overpass Turbo API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API)
